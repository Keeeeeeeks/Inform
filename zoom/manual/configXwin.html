  <h1>
    Configuring Zoom: X-Windows
  </h1>

  <p>
    Under X-Windows, Zoom does not currently provide a graphical
    interface for configuration. Instead, you can configure Zoom by
    editting a <code>.zoomrc</code> file in your home directory, or a
    global <code>zoomrc</code> in <code>/usr/local/share/zoom</code>
    by default (this will be created when you install Zoom). It is
    probably advisable to copy this default file to your home
    directory and edit it rather than create a whole new file from
    scratch.
  </p>

  <p>
    The .zoomrc file consists of a single default definition, followed
    by an optional number of definitions for individual games. Game
    definitions can override any option defined in the default
    defintion (so you can give a particular game different fonts, for
    example). However, this feature is most often used for setting the
    title of individual games to something more descriptive than the
    filename and serial number.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each definition in the zoomrc file begins with a specifier that
    indicates which game it is for. This is of the form '<code>game
    &quot;&lt;title&gt;&quot; &lt;serial numbers&gt;</code>'. The
    default definition is specified by '<code>default
    &quot;&lt;title&gt;&quot;</code>'. The title can be any string you
    like - the default is <code>&quot;%s (%i.%.6s.%04x)&quot;</code> (this piece of magic
    tells Zoom to substitute in the filename and serial number of the
    game). Serial numbers have two forms: RELEASE.SERIAL (eg
    23.020901 - most games display their release and serial numbers at
    startup) and RELEASE.SERIAL.CHECKSUM (eg 23.020901.6f94 - Zoom
    displays this form in its title bar when you use the default
    title). The advantage of the latter is that it is much more unlikely
    that any two games will have the same ID. If a game has multiple
    releases, you can specify multiple IDs by seperating them with commas.
  </p>

  <p>
    The specifier may, optionally, be followed by a list of options
    enclosed in curly brackets ({}). A complete list of these follows:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>interpreter &lt;number&gt;</dt>
    <dd>
      Defines the interpreter number to report to the game. This
      doesn't make very much difference in most modern games, however,
      several Infocom games (especially version 6 ones) inspect this
      to guess the interpreter features. The numbers Infocom used are
      as follows:

      <ul class=titchy>
        <li>1 - Infocom's internal debugging interpreter
        <li>2 - Applie IIe interpreter
        <li>3 - Macintosh (Zoom's behaviour most closely resembles
          this interpreter, and this is the default value)
	<li>4 - Amiga (colour behaviour can change if you specify
	  this)
        <li>5 - Atari ST
        <li>6 - IBM PC
        <li>7 - Commodore 128
        <li>8 - Commodore 64
        <li>9 - Apple IIc
        <li>10 - Apple IIgs
        <li>11 - Tandy Color
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>revision &lt;character&gt;</dt>
    <dd>
      Specifies the version of the interpreter to claim: Infocom
      conventionally used a letter for this purpose, and this is the
      format that Zoom accepts (for example, <code>revision
      Z</code>). Games usually just print this at the start and
      otherwise ignore it.
    </dd>

    <dt>font &lt;number&gt; &quot;&lt;name&gt;&quot; &lt;style&gt;</dt>
    <dd>
      There are three ways a font name can be specified under
      X-Windows: as a standard X font specifier; as path to an Adobe
      Type 1 font file and as the special string
      '<code>font3</code>'. You can obtain an X font specifier using
      the <code>xfontsel</code> utility. Type 1 fonts are only
      available if Zoom was compiled with T1Lib support built in: the
      file name should be followed by a space and a number indicating
      the font size (in pixels) - ghostscript comes with a useful
      selection of type 1 fonts that can be used. 'font3' is a special
      font indicating that Zoom should use the 'symbolic' font 3 that
      it has built in. The 'style' parameter indicates for which
      display styles the font should be used. <code>roman</code> is
      the default style. The style can also be one, or a combination
      of, <code>fixed</code>, <code>bold</code>, <code>italic</code>
      and <code>symbolic</code>: combine styles with '-' - eg
      '<code>fixed-bold-italic</code>'. You should provide at least
      <code>roman</code> and <code>fixed</code> fonts: there are a
      total of 16 possible styles, but most games only use the 'pure'
      styles rather than combinations.
      <p>
        The number should be unique for each font, counting from 1.
      </p>
      <p>
      NOTE: Zoom will use Xft for font rendering if at all
      possible. This enables anti-aliasing, and also provides support
      for rendering Unicode. Zoom will, however, fall back to the
      standard X font system if Xft is not available for any reason.
      Any fixed pitch fonts should be specified as being the same
      size, and Type 1 fonts do not make good fixed-pitch fonts.
    </dd>

    <dt>antialias &lt;yes/no&gt;</dt>
    <dd>
      If you have XRender installed, or are using Type 1 fonts, Zoom
      will anti-alias its display by default. Setting this option to
      'no' will turn off this feature (images are always anti-aliased,
      when a game features them). This will disable Xft rendering -
      note that this means that Zoom cannot render Unicode
      characters.
    </dd>

    <dt>colours &lt;colours&gt;</dt>
    <dd>
      The Z-Machine has 10 default colours - this option allows you to
      define them. Each colour is specified as a string of the form
      '<code>(Red, Green, Blue)</code>', wher Red, Green and Blue are
      numbers in the range 0 - 255. Colours are seperated with commas,
      and are defined starting with colour 0. You should provide at
      least the 8 standard colours. The Z-Machine colours are defined
      as follows:

      <ul class=titchy>
        <li>0 - Black
        <li>1 - Red
        <li>2 - Green
        <li>3 - Yellow
        <li>4 - Blue
        <li>5 - Magenta
        <li>6 - Cyan
        <li>7 - White
        <li>8 - Light grey
        <li>9 - Medium grey
        <li>10 - Dark grey
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>size &lt;x&gt; , &lt;y&gt;</dt>
    <dd>
      Specifies the size of the game window, in characters. The window
      will be created big enough to fit in x fixed-pitch characters
      across, and y down.
    </dd>

    <dt>gamedir &quot;&lt;path&gt;&quot;</dt>
    <dd>
      When Zoom is started up with no arguments, it will look in this
      directory to see if it can present a menu of games.
    </dd>

    <dt>savedir &quot;&lt;path&gt;&quot;</dt>
    <dd>
      Zoom will save and load games in the directory you specify here
      by default.
    </dd>

    <dt>resources &quot;&lt;path&gt;&quot;</dt>
    <dd>
      Some games require extra resources in the form of a Blorb
      file. This directive tells Zoom where to find these resources -
      if it is not specified, Zoom will check for a resource file in
      the same directory as the game, with the same name except for a
      '.blb' extension. If you explicitly specify this, Zoom will
      <b>always</b> load the resource file, even if the game
      identifier in the file does not match that of the game you are
      running.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Example definition</h2>

  <p>
    This provides an example of a definition for a game. Note that any
    options not specified for a game will be taken from the
    <code>default</code> block.
