  <h1>
    Debugging with Zoom
  </h1>

  <p>
    Zoom has a built-in source-level debugger for games compiled with
    Inform. To work, it requires that you compile with Inform's -k
    option - this creates the gameinfo.dbg file that Zoom uses to find
    out how the Z-Code file relates to the source files. While
    debugging, it is recommended that you leave all files where Inform
    does, and run Zoom from the directory that the game was compiled
    in. Zoom will make an effort to find files if you don't do this,
    but it may not be able to find everything. Note that Zoom's
    debugger does not currently work in version 6 games.
  </p>

  <p>
    Zoom's debug mode is intended to reach those parts that Infix
    can't. It does not provide the kind of object manipulation
    commands that Infix does, instead providing commands to single
    step through code, set breakpoints and even evaluation Inform
    expressions. It is a useful tool to help track down bugs that
    crash the interpreter, or problems with algorithms that Infix is
    too 'coarse' to track down.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To start Zoom in debug mode under X-windows, use the '-D' option
    when starting Zoom (ie <code>zoom -D buggygame.z5</code>). In the
    Mac OS X version, run the Zoom application and tick the 'Debug
    mode' checkbox in the initial open dialog. If Zoom can
    successfully start debug mode, the game will be introduced with a
    prompt similar to the following:
  </p>

  <pre class=example>
= loading symbols from 'gameinfo.dbg'
=
= Welcome to Zoom's symbolic debug mode
= 664 symbols, 345 known routines, in 10 files
= Type 'h' for help
=
== Parser:33 (Main)
== [ Main; InformLibrary.play(); ];
= :
  </pre>

  <p>
    <code>= :</code> is Zoom's debug prompt: it indicates you can now
    use debugging commands. Debug prompts are usually in blue on
    white, and begin with an '=' sign, to distinguish them from the
    game text. Debug commands all consist of a single letter. Some of
    them can be followed by a parameter. 
  </p>

  <h2>
    Execution flow commands
  </h2>

  <p>
    These commands control how the program is being run. They include
    commands to set breakpoints and step through the program.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>b &lt;address&gt; - set breakpoint</dt>
    <dd>
      Sets a breakpoint at the given program address. Zoom will stop
      execution and drop into the debugger as soon as this address is
      reached. There are two forms of address:
      <code>file:line</code> (eg <code>Parser:33</code>) - this sets a
      breakpoint at the given line in a particular file; the other
      form is simple <code>function</code> (eg <code>Main</code>),
      which sets a breakpoint at the start of the specified
      function. Functions use the names that Inform gives them in the
      symbol file: these are usually the names that you give them, but
      to break in a function declared as part of an object, you need
      to use the 'Object.Function' form, and for a function in a
      class, 'Class::Function'.
    </dd>

    <dt>s - single step</dt>
    <dd>
      Moves on to the next statement, then re-enters the debugger. If
      a function is called, moves to the first statement in that
      function.
    </dd>

    <dt>n - single step</dt>
    <dd>
      As for <code>s</code>, but 'steps over' functions (ie, single
      steps to the next statement in the current function)
    </dd>

    <dt>f - finish function</dt>
    <dd>
      Continues executing until the current function returns, then
      re-enters the debugger.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>
    Data inspection commands
  </h2>

  <p>
    These commands allow you to inspect the current state of play of a
    program, by printing out the values of variables, for instance.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>p &lt;expression&gt; - print</dt>
    <dd>
      Prints the result of evaluating &lt;expression&gt;. The
      expression is in standard Inform syntax (so you can <code>p
      location.n_to</code>, for example). Zoom supports the following
      operators in expressions: <code>+ - * / % & | ~ . .& .# -&gt;
      --&gt;</code>
    </dd>

    <dt>d &lt;expression&gt; - display</dt>
    <dd>
      'Displays' the given expression. It will be re-printed everytime
      the debugger notices it has changed (the debugger only checks at
      breakpoints and when single-stepping)
    </dd>

    <dt>t - backtrace</dt>
    <dd>
      Displays a stack backtrace: a list of the functions that have
      been called to get to the current location, and where they were
      called from.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Miscellaneous commands</h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>h - help</dt>
    <dd>
      Displays a quick summary of the commands supported by the debugger
    </dd>

    <dt>l - list breakpoints</dt>
    <dd>
      Displays a list of the breakpoints that are currently set.
    </dd>
  </dl>
