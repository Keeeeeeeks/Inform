  <h1>
    Configuring Zoom: Mac OS X
  </h1>

  <p>
    Under Mac OS X, Zoom is configured by choosing the
    'Preferences...' option from the <b>Zoom</b> menu. This will pop
    up the preferences dialog. Zoom will apply and save the settings
    when the box is closed. Some settings will only take effect when
    the game is restarted - the game's own restart command will
    usually suffice for this.
  </p>

  <h2>General settings</h2>
  <p class=figure align=center><img src="generalset.png"></p>

  <p>
    These options configure general features of Zoom. The settings
    apply globally: you cannot configure them for individual
    games. The options are as follows:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Display warnings</dt>
    <dd>
      If a game does something thats slightly against the Z-Machine
      standard, Zoom will print a warning informing you of this. Most
      useful for programmers
    </dd>

    <dt>Warnings are fatal</dt>
    <dd>
      If a warning is displayed, treat it as a fatal error and end Zoom.
    </dd>

    <dt>Speak game text</dt>
    <dd>
      Supplies the text of the game to speech manager for output. This
      does not work for version 6 games, due to the more complicated
      display model.
    </dd>

    <dt>QuickDraw/Quartz rendering</dt>
    <dd>
      Zoom can render using the old-fashioned QuickDraw style or the
      new-fangled Quartz style. Quartz provides superior quality
      fonts, and Zoom provides slightly better Unicode support under
      Quartz. However, QuickDraw is much faster at rendering.
    </dd>

    <dt>Antialiasing</dt>
    <dd>
      Only affects the Quartz renderer. Some people find anti-aliased
      text to look blurry and hard to read. This option allows you to
      turn it off.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2>Game</h2>
  <p class=figure align=center><img src="game.png"></p>

  <p>
    This tab allows you to set general options relating to the
    game. When you get a new game, you will very likely want to set
    the title to change it from Zoom's rather boring default. Advanced
    users may want to change the interpreter and revision to get
    different effects. If you tick the checkboxes, the setting will
    apply only to the game you have currently loaded; unticked, the
    settings will apply to all games.
  </p>

  <p>
    Infocom defines the following interpreter numbers:
  </p>

      <ul class=titchy>
        <li>1 - Infocom's internal debugging interpreter
        <li>2 - Applie IIe interpreter
        <li>3 - Macintosh (Zoom's behaviour most closely resembles
          this interpreter, and this is the default value)
	<li>4 - Amiga (colour behaviour can change if you specify
	  this)
        <li>5 - Atari ST
        <li>6 - IBM PC
        <li>7 - Commodore 128
        <li>8 - Commodore 64
        <li>9 - Apple IIc
        <li>10 - Apple IIgs
        <li>11 - Tandy Color
      </ul>

  <h2>Fonts</h2>
  <p class=figure align=center><img src="fonts.png"></p>

  <p>
    This tab allows you to set the fonts Zoom will be using. If the
    checkbox is ticked, the settings will apply only to the game you
    have currently loaded, otherwise they will apply to all games. You
    are free to choose any combination of fonts, but for best results,
    make sure that the fixed pitch fonts are all the same size and
    shape. Some version 6 games do not deal well with any fonts being
    a different size.
  </p>

  <h2>Colours</h2>
  <p class=figure align=center><img src="colours.png"></p>

  <p>
    This tab allows you to set the 10 default Z-Machine colours. As
    before, the checkbox indicates whether or not the settings apply
    to just the loaded game or to all games. Click on a colour
    name to change it.
  </p>

  <h2>Resources</h2>
  <p class=figure align=center><img src="resources.png"></p>

  <p>
    This tab shows the resources in use for a game. If Zoom has found
    the resources itself (without any help), the field will be
    blank. You can help Zoom by dragging a resource file to the
    window: this will replace any resources that are currently loaded
    with the new file, and Zoom will try to load this file when the
    game is started in the future. It is highly recommended that you
    restart a game after loadeding new resources. These settings
    always apply to an individual game.
