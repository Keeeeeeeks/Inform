About Zoom PlugIns
==================

    The OS X version of Zoom supports plug-ins for otherwise unsupported
	game types. These take the form of bundles, which Zoom will load as
	necessary (either to support the iFiction window or to play a
	specific game). The standard plug-in format would be a Glk game,
	however, it should be possible to write plug-ins for any game
	engine that can be converted to Cocoa.
