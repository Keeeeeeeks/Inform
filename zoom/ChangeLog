2000-12-06  Andrew Hunter    <andrew@logicalshift.co.uk>

	* random number generator added (no longer relies on whatever your
	OS provides for srand and rand)
	
	* version updated to 0.9.99dev8
	
	* merged windows version back into CVS. Main changes are the use of
	the noyywrap option in the lexers, windisplay.c, printf_debug and
	related functions and cygwin & cross-compiling detection. There's
	also a hack for Borland cc's inlining code which causes gcc to
	emit a warning - note that push() is now defined in both interp.c
	and state.c.

2000-11-27  Andrew Hunter    <andrew@logicalshift.co.uk>

	* unicode fixes, unicode table in header extension block now supported

2000-11-25  Andrew Hunter    <andrew@logicalshift.co.uk>

	* display drivers changed to support ISO 10646 characters. That
	is, Unicode. Now plays the German version of Zork I, although for
	some obscure reason it doesn't recognise 'ja'...

2000-11-21  Andrew Hunter    <andrew@logicalshift.co.uk>

	* header flags now set (more?) correctly
	
2000-11-20  Andrew Hunter    <andrew@logicalshift.co.uk>

	* graphics mode added for those version 5 games as support it -
	not many.

2000-11-19  Andrew Hunter    <andrew@logicalshift.co.uk>

	* read_char timing implemented
	
	* bug fixed in timed input
	
	* state_decompile silly bug fixed
	
	* input_stream implemented, bugs in output_stream fixed

	* freetype work abandoned; freetype far too buggy
	
2000-11-17  Andrew Hunter    <andrew@logicalshift.co.uk>

	* freetype work started. Version changed to 0.9.99dev6
	
2000-11-10  Andrew Hunter    <andrew@logicalshift.co.uk>

	* restore was reporting file was too small when it actually
	doesn't exist. Fixed.
	
	* v3 save was storing the wrong address in PC under some
	circumstances. Fixed

	* savedir option added to .zoomrc

	* V6 support improved further... Zork Zero is now displaying
	almost correctly

2000-11-09  Andrew Hunter    <andrew@logicalshift.co.uk>

        * bug fixed in xdisplay.c that caused the cursor to slowly
	creep across the screen in Border Zone

	* The Lurking Horror accesses out-of-range property 32 sometimes.
	Changed this condition to a warning instead of a fatal error
	
	* menu added, to appear when the user specifies no game on the
	commandline

	* bug fixed in state.c - it wasn't storing the stack correctly
	(or, indeed, at all)	

	* V6 support improved... ZorkZero looks slightly better

2000-11-08  Andrew Hunter    <andrew@logicalshift.co.uk>
	
	* version changed to 0.9.99dev5

	* changed builder to new format. Now uses gotos rather than calling
	subroutines. This is a manual inlining of the functions - we get the
	speed increases encountered before, but without the compiler
	problems, or the size increase. Standard speed of the interpreter
	is just over twice the speed of frotz (2.32). The new format of
	the zcode.ops file removed the need for op.c altogether.

2000-11-07  Andrew Hunter    <andrew@logicalshift.co.uk>

	* version changed to 0.9.99dev4
	
	* zoom-0.9.99beta3 released

	* debugging: started adding attribute, property and object watch
	routines

	* bugfixes: transcript now works when header bit is
	set. Seastalker window display fixed. Undo no longer leaks
	memory. zoomrc file added to tarball. Save/restore now print
	reasons when they fail. Output stream 3 fixed to comply better
	with specification.

	* version changed to 0.9.99dev3
