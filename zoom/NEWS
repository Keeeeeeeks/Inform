08/08/2002:
	Hooray for bugs! Fixed the following problems: @sound_data was
	broken; images didn't render quite right for v6; fixes to
	@set_font, @read_mouse, @save, @restore and @erase_picture;
	some fiddling to make the Xft code a bit more user friendly;
	picture bit was being set to 0; spec 1.1 header extension
	words implemented; fixes to 1.1 unicode strings.

06/08/2002:
	Released beta1.

22/07/2002:
	Some new features. Many bug fixes, started work on v6 support and
	standard 1.1 compliance (even though it isn't finalised yet...).

29/06/2002:
	Plenty of work on the Unix/Linux version: the display code has
	been rewritten, which might make porting easier, but more
	importantly means that scrollback is now supported in this
	port. Support for T1Lib and Xft has also been added, which
	improves the quality of the display immeasurably (if you like
	anti-aliasing at any rate).

	Started work on a symbolic debug mode. Should make a nice
	complement to Infix.
