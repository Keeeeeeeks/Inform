<b>Summary of action descriptions</b>
<p>
<b>To describe a specific action</b> (for instance in a &quot;try&quot; phrase), use the chart above and fill in exact values in place of each blue <font color="#000080">something</font>. Thus &quot;try looking&quot; or &quot;try unlocking the grating with the iron key&quot;.
<p>
<b>To describe a pattern of actions</b> (for instance in an &quot;instead&quot; rule), further optional clauses are available, and should appear in the order given below.
<p><blockquote>
	<font color="#000080">action</font> <b>or</b> <font color="#000080">list of actions</font> <b>or</b> <font color="#000080">kind of action</font>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in <font color="#000080">room</font>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the presence of <font color="#000080">something</font>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when <font color="#000080">condition</font>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color="#000080">repetition</font>
</blockquote><p>
A list of actions might be &quot;taking or dropping the key&quot;, but each action must apply to the same object(s). A kind of action will be as specified elsewhere in the source, e.g., &quot;Attacking a person is violent behaviour&quot; creates a kind of action called &quot;violent behaviour&quot;. Any of the &quot;somethings&quot; above, or the &quot;room&quot;, can be described vaguely using properties and kinds: thus &quot;in a lighted room&quot;, or &quot;in the presence of a woman&quot;, or &quot;examining an open container&quot;. Following such a description by text like &quot;(called the receptacle)&quot; assigns a name to whatever is matched.
<p>
The going action has additional options, which can be given in any order:
<p><blockquote>
	going <b>or</b> going <font color="#000080">direction</font>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to <font color="#000080">room</font> <b>or</b> nowhere
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from <font color="#000080">room</font>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by <font color="#000080">vehicle</font>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through <font color="#000080">door</font>
	<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with <font color="#000080">something being pushed</font>
</blockquote><p>
If any of the from, to, by, through or with clauses are given, then the action is matched only if there is a potential route in the direction being tried. Thus &quot;going from the Solarium&quot; will not be matched if the player types &quot;go east&quot; in the Solarium and there is no east exit, but &quot;going east&quot;, &quot;going nowhere&quot; or &quot;going east in the Solarium&quot; will.
<p>
<font color="#000080">Repetition</font> is quoted either in &quot;times&quot; (number of times this has happened in the whole game to date) or &quot;turns&quot; (number of consecutive turns on which this has happened): thus &quot;once&quot;, &quot;at least twice&quot;, &quot;for the 13th time&quot;, &quot;at most six times&quot;, &quot;for two to five turns&quot;. (Numbers can be textual up to 10 but must be given in digits from 11.) The description &quot;doing it&quot; means &quot;the same action as described just now, but with a different <font color="#000080">repetition</font>&quot;: thus &quot;Instead of taking a container for the first time...&quot; might be followed by &quot;Instead of doing it for the second time...&quot;.
