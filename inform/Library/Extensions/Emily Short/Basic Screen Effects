Table of Ordinary Status

Status bar table is a table-name that varies. Status bar table is the Table of Ordinary Status.

To fill status bar with (selected table - a table-name):
	let n be the number of rows in the selected table;
	deepen status line to n rows;
	let index be 1;
	repeat through selected table
	begin;
		move cursor to index; 
		say "[left entry]";
		center central entry at row index;
		right align cursor to index;
		say "[right entry]";
		change index to index + 1;
	end repeat.


Basic Screen Effects ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

Basic Screen Effects implements the following effects: pauses to wait for a keypress from the player; clearing the screen; changing the color of the foreground font; and changing the color of the background. The following phrases are defined:

To clear the entire screen of everything it contains, including the status line,

	clear the screen.

To clear the text portion of the window, but not the status line:

	clear only the main screen.

To produce a pause until the player types any key:

	wait for any key.

To produce a pause until the player types SPACE, ignoring all other keys:

	wait for the SPACE key.

To give the player a message saying to press SPACE to continue, wait for a keypress, and then clear the screen before continuing the action:

	pause the game.

In extreme cases, we may want to end the game without allowing the player an opportunity to RESTART, RESTORE, or QUIT; to this end:

	stop game abruptly.

Show the current quotation displays whatever the author has selected with "display the boxed quotation...". Ordinarily boxed quotations appear when the prompt is printed, but this allows the author to show a boxed quote at another time. To achieve a splash-screen before the game proper begins, we could do something like this:

	When play begins:
		display the boxed quotation 
		"What's this room? I've forgotten my compass.
		Well, this'll be south-south-west parlour by living room.
		-- Philadelphia Story";
		show the current quotation;
		pause the game.

Similarly, we can display a phrase centered in the middle of the screen but without the background-coloration of the boxed quotation, like this:

	center "The Merchant of Venice";

Centering text puts the text on its own new line, since it would not make much sense otherwise. If we want to make our own calculations using this information, the width of the screen can be checked at any time, like so:

	if the screen width is less than 75, say "The map will not display properly until you widen your screen." instead.

We can also use a variation of the center command to position text in the status line. To produce a Trinity-style status line with the location, centered:

	Rule for constructing the status line:
		center "[location]" at row 1;
		rule succeeds.

For status lines of more than one row, we can create a table representing the overall appearance of the desired status line and then set that table as our status bar table. The following would build a two-line status bar with all sorts of information in it. (For a more practical demonstration involving a three-line compass rose, see the example below.)
 
	Table of Fancy Status
	left	central	right 
	" [location]"	"[time of day]"	"[score]"
	" [hair color of the suspect]"	"[eye color of the suspect]"	"[cash]"

Rule for constructing the status line:
		fill status bar with Table of Fancy Status;
		rule succeeds.
 
A status bar table must always have left, central, and right columns, and we must provide the rule for constructing the status line. Otherwise, Inform will use the default status line behavior.

To turn the background black (or red, green, yellow, blue, white, magenta, or cyan):

	turn the background black. 
	turn the background red. 

...and so on. This only applies to what is typed from that point in the game onward. If we wish to turn the entire background a new color at once (and this is usually desirable), we should set the background and then clear the screen, so:

	turn the background black;
	clear the screen.

Finally, font colors can be changed with say (color) letters, where the same range of colors may be used as for the background. So for instance

	say "There is a [red letters]piping hot[default letters] pie on the table."

We should be careful with color effects. Some older interpreters do not deal well with color, and part of the audience plays interactive fiction on black and white devices or via a screenreader. The phrase "say default letters" restores whatever background and foreground are normal on this system; it is not safe to assume that the player is necessarily using one particular color scheme; black-on-white, white-on-black, and white-on-blue are all relatively common.

Example: ** Pillaged Village - A status bar showing unvisited rooms in a colored compass rose.

	"Pillaged Village" by Lars Thurgoodson.
	
	Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.

	The story headline is "An interactive looting".

	The Viking Longship is west of the Seashore. The Seashore is west of the Burning Village. The Shrine of the Green Man is northwest of the Burning Village. The Shattered Fort is southwest of the Burning Village. The Treetop is above the Shrine.

	When play begins:
	     center "[story title]";
	     center "[story headline]";
	     center "by [story author]";
	     leave space;
	     center "Press SPACE to begin.";
	     wait for the SPACE key;
	     clear the screen;
	     leave space.

	To turn screen black:
		say white letters;
		turn the background black;
		clear the screen;
		leave space;
	
	To turn screen white:
		turn the background white;
		say black letters;
		clear the screen;
		leave space.

	To leave space:
		say paragraph break;
		say paragraph break;
		say paragraph break;
		say paragraph break.
