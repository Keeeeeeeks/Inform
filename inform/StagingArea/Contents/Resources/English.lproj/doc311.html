<p class="sectionheading">ยง18.26. Printing the locale description of something</p>
<p><span class="boldface">1. When it happens.</span> A &quot;locale description&quot; is Inform jargon for the part of a room description which catalogues the visible items in the room. When looking, Inform will normally print the description of the room itself, followed by a locale description for the room. But if the player is in a cage in the room, there will be two locale descriptions: one for the room, then another for the cage. This activity is used to write the locale description for a single domain, and the &quot;something&quot; can be either a room, an enterable container, or an enterable supporter.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">2. The default behaviour.</span> Is quite complicated, and is written up in full in the typeset form of the Standard Rules downloadable from the Inform website. Briefly, though: we first run the &quot;choosing notable locale objects&quot; activity to find out what ought to be mentioned here. That assembles a list of things to mention, sorted into priority order. Items with priority 1 go first, then those with priority 2, and so on. The &quot;printing a locale paragraph&quot; activity is run for each, and in practice that usually hands the job over to &quot;writing a paragraph about&quot;. Sometimes a paragraph will indeed be written, but not always. Sometimes there is nothing interesting to say, and an item is left until a final, single paragraph which gathers up the leftovers (&quot;You can also see a scarlet fish, a harmonium and a kite here.&quot;), the printing of which is done by the &quot;listing nondescript items of&quot; activity. As soon as any item picks up the either/or property &quot;mentioned&quot;, by having its name printed, it is struck out so that it will not appear subsequently, whatever its priority.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">3. Examples.</span> As general advice: if the effect wanted can be got using &quot;writing a paragraph about&quot; and &quot;listing nondescript items of&quot; alone, use those; if it's necessary to meddle further, use &quot;choosing notable locale objects&quot; and &quot;printing a locale paragraph&quot; to alter the normal processes; use the all-powerful &quot;printing the locale description&quot; activity only when the whole process needs to be altered, not the item-by-item workings.</p>
<p>(a) In the Very Misty Moorlands, nothing on the ground can ordinarily be seen through the swirling mist, so the locale description is suppressed entirely:</p>

<p>When it comes time to start manipulating the priorities of items, it is useful to be able to check the table for debugging purposes; the problem is that printing the names of the objects can itself affect the way the room description is generated, foiling our debugging efforts.</p>
<p>What follows is a rule to help with debugging safely, and a sample of how priorities work:</p>

Rule for writing a paragraph about the early bird: say &quot;The early bird always appears first, and here it is.&quot;

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This procedure also means (as you can test by experiment) that after the late edition has been picked up and dropped again, it lists in no special order in the &quot;you can see...&quot; paragraph (since initial appearances only print when the object has not yet been moved).</p>
<p>The other thing to note is that by default that final collection of generic objects (&quot;You can also see...&quot;) appears at the end, regardless of the priority of everything else. If we really wanted to, though, we could force something to appear even after that paragraph, by adding a new listing rule to the locale description rules:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c6790_299" -->
<a id="c6790_299"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The late listing rule is listed after the you-can-also-see rule in the for printing the locale description rules.
