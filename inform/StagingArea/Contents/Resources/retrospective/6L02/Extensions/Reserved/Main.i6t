B/maint: Main Template.

@Purpose: The top-level logic of NI: the sequence of operations followed by
NI up to the point where the output file is opened, resuming after it is
closed again.

@-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@p Startup.
This segment of the template is not like any other. It contains almost the
complete logical sequence of operations followed by NI -- indeed, NI
essentially works by parsing some command-line arguments to set switches
and then asking the template interpreter to run through "Main.i6t", the
only template file which must always exist. (The other template files are
only ever involved when called on by the |{-segment:...}| command from a
template file already running.) Whereas most template segments contain
I6 code to pass through into NI's output, this one runs both before and
after NI's output file is being written, and contains only commands.

The Startup paragraph is not in fact modifiable in any easy way, because of
course "Include..." sentences -- used to tell the template interpreter
to override the template files -- will not be understood until long after
this paragraph has been fully dealt with. But perhaps that's no bad thing.

@p Semantic Analysis.
Similarly: Include... sentences are not read until this paragraph is long
forgotten.

{-callv:Data::Tables::traverse_to_create}
{-callv:Code::Phrases::traverse_for_names}

@p Assertion Reading.
Since Include... sentences are read during pass 2, they might just be able to
meddle by adding instructions to take place after this paragraph, but would
be too late to work before or instead of it.

@c
{-progress-stage:2}
{-log-phase:First pass through assertions}
{-read-assertions:1}
{-callv:Data::Tables::traverse_to_stock}
{-log-phase:Second pass through assertions}

{-callv:Code::Phrases::parse_rule_placements}
{-callv:Data::Equations::traverse_to_stock}

{-callv:Problems::empty_all_headings}

@p Code Generation.
This is where we hand over to regular template files -- containing code
passed through as I6 source, as well as a few further commands -- starting
with "Output.i6t".

@p Metadata.

@c

@p Indexing.
This paragraph can be skipped without harming any of the rest of NI's work:
the only effect is to suppress the generation of the index. (Indeed, if
NI is called with the |-noindex| command-line switch, then the template
interpreter ignores all commands in between |{-open-index}| and
|{-close-index}|, thus skipping exactly this paragraph.)
